# Scenario: Multi-client file server  
# use of Channels in java nio


## Description
I present a comprehensive scenario that
includes the use of methods, classes and 
interfaces of java.nio.channels and java.nio.channels.spi packages. 
This scenario is the implementation 
of a multipurpose server that responds to requests
from multiple clients using non-blocking I/O. In this example,
the server responds to TCP requests to send and receive files.
